# DroneDetector
This repository contains the dataset used in the creation of a custom object detector, specifically designed to detect drones.

The images are split into train/test and contain one drone flying. There are both clear sky and overcast weather images. The images show the drone at varying distances from the camera. Each image has an associated xml file, which contains the bounding box information used to train the object detector.
